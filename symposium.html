   <h3>Workshop</h3>
    <h4>Workshops</h4>
    <p class="body">
    	ICSTA'19 is pleased to announce a the Workshop "Deep Learning and Computer Vision," presented by Dr. Robert Blanchard, a Senior Analytical Training Consultant from Statistical Analysis Software (SAS). The four hour workshop will focus on the pivotal aspects of a deep learning model (itâ€™s not all about the hidden layers), the building blocks of a convolutional neural network, and how to apply a computer vision model to solve image classification tasks.

All registrants to the conference are welcome to attend the four hour workshop at no additional fee.
