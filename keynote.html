  <p class="body">Chamil received his BSc (Hons) in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka with the award of best performance in Mechanical Engineering in 2007. Then, he received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering in 2011 from the Queens University Belfast, UK with several publications where one of his publications was awarded with a young author best paper award from the IEEE in 2011. After having a few academic positions, Chamil joined the Faculty of Science and Engineering of University of Manchester (UoM) as an Assistant Professor in October 2015. Currently Chamil is working mainly with the Northwest Composts Centre and the Aerospace Research Institute of the UoM. So far, he has authored 35+ peer-reviewed journal/conference papers. Moreover, he is the author of the monograph Polymer Extrusion: A Study on Thermal Monitoring Techniques and Melting Issues. His research interests include: Process Monitoring, Modelling and Control; Soft Sensors and Soft Sensing; Process Instrumentation; Energy Efficiency; and Heat Transfer. At present, he is mainly researching in the areas such as melt flow behaviour in polymer processing, 3D printing, development of inferential (soft) sensors for processing applications, heat transfer (heat flow and cooling) in gas turbine applications. He is an associate member of the IESL, IMechE, ICPM and also a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy UK.</p>

 <p class="body">Jalel Azaiez is currently a Professor at the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering in the University of Calgary (Canada). He is also Associate Dean in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. He holds a Dilôme d’Ingénieur from the Ecole Centrale de Paris (France) and a M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Stanford University (U.S.A.) both in Chemical Engineering. 
His recent research focuses on modelling fluid flow instabilities and in particular those involving complex flows in porous media. These include non-isothermal flows with or without chemical reactions, involving Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with a particular focus on nanofluids in micro-geometries. His research team has developed a number of software and mathematical algorithms to analyze flow instabilities under a wide variety of conditions that have applications in the fields of oil recovery, soil remediation and materials processing. He holds a number of awards on his research and teaching accomplishments. He serves on the editorial board of three Journals and has presented invited talks and seminars in numerous worldwide forums (Belgium, France, Japan, USA, etc.).</p>
