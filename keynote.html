  <p class="body">Yogendra P. Chaubey obtained his M. Stat. degree from the Indian Statistical institute in 1972 and joined the University of Rochester for his doctoral degree. After completing his Ph.D. from the University of Rochester, he took up a Post-Doctoral position at the Carleton University and subsequently joined Dalhousie University, Halifax as an Assistant Professor (1977-79). He moved to Concordia University, Montreal in 1979, where he currently holds the position of Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Dr. Chaubey served the department of mathematics as Chair during 2005-20014 and 2016-17. </p>

<p>He has been quite active in promoting Statistics through membership in various capacities of several statistical associations. He has served as an organizer of several academic sessions for several scholarly conferences, notably those held at Concordia University in 1991, 2001 and 2011. He also organized a workshop on Nonparametric Curve Smoothing (NCS 2013) at Concordia University in 2013. </p>

<p>He is an elected member of International Statistical Institute since 2005 and is a member of Provost's Circle at Concordia University. He was honored with "Life Achievement Award" for his contributions to Statistical Theory and Practice at the Silver Jubilee International Conference on Interdisciplinary Mathematics, Statistics and Computational Techniques of Forum for Interdisciplinary Mathematics in association with Manipal University, Jaipur, India, during December 22-24, 2016. He also gave several invited talks at international scholarly conferences, including one at the recent 2017 World Statistics Congress held in Morocco. His current area of research is focused on non-parametric functional estimation that is funded by a discovery grant from Natural Sciences and Research Council of Canada.</p>

 <p class="body">Jalel Azaiez is currently a Professor at the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering in the University of Calgary (Canada). He is also Associate Dean in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. He holds a Dilôme d’Ingénieur from the Ecole Centrale de Paris (France) and a M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Stanford University (U.S.A.) both in Chemical Engineering. 
His recent research focuses on modelling fluid flow instabilities and in particular those involving complex flows in porous media. These include non-isothermal flows with or without chemical reactions, involving Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with a particular focus on nanofluids in micro-geometries. His research team has developed a number of software and mathematical algorithms to analyze flow instabilities under a wide variety of conditions that have applications in the fields of oil recovery, soil remediation and materials processing. He holds a number of awards on his research and teaching accomplishments. He serves on the editorial board of three Journals and has presented invited talks and seminars in numerous worldwide forums (Belgium, France, Japan, USA, etc.).</p>
