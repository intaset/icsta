    <p class="body">Manuscripts are invited for the 1<sup>st</sup> International Conference on Statistics: Theory and Applications (ICSTA'19) on topics lying within the scope of the conference. All contributions must be original and should not have been published elsewhere.</p>

    <p class="body"><i>Three types of manuscripts</i> could be published in the conference proceedings:</p>

    <ul>
	<li>Extended Abstracts</li>
	<li>Short Papers</li>
	<li>Full Papers</li>
	</ul>

    <p class="body">You may choose to submit any of the above based on the the weight of the contributions in your manuscript.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><b>Extended abstracts</b> are welcome for publication. These submissions should be around 500 words and must give a clear indication of the objectives, scope, and results (if available) of the research. No figures or tables are allowed. Presentation for these submissions are limited to 10 minutes (if oral) or poster.</li>

    <li><b>Short papers</b> must give a clear indication of the objectives, scope, and results of the paper, and must (at least) contain an abstract, an introduction, a results/discussion section, and a reference section. Short papers are limited to 4 pages. Presentation for these submissions are limited to 20 minutes (if oral) or poster.</li>

    <li><b>Full Papers</b> are limited to 8 pages and are more descriptive of the work that has been done. Also, more sections, images, graphs, and results could be presented. Presentation for these submissions are limited to 20 minutes (if oral) or poster.</li>
	</ul>

    <p class="body">Please note that a .docx template is available to guide the authors in formatting their papers. All papers (including extended abstracts) <b>must</b> comply with the template.</p>

    <p class="body">You may find the conference template(s) for ICSTA'19 below:</p>

    <!-- <p class="bold">*If you submit your camera-ready paper via LaTeX, we ask that you kindly consider the following:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Within the .rar folder, we ask that you kindly send us ONLY the .tex files, figures and bibliographies</li>
    <li>Please send the PDF conversion in a SEPERATE attachment (please do not include it in the .rar folder)</li>

    <p class="body">Papers should be prepared in English and carefully checked for correct grammar. Figures should be of high quality. To ensure high scientific quality, all papers will be reviewed by the Scientific Committee Members. All papers must be submitted in electronic form using the web site of the conference.</p>

    <p class="body">Once the reviewing process is complete, the contact author of each paper will be notified of the result by e-mail. The authors are required to follow the reviews in order to improve their paper before their final submission.</p>

    <p class="body">All accepted extended abstracts, short, and full papers will be published in the proceedings, under an ISBN reference in a USB drive. The online version of the proceedings will also be published under an ISSN reference and each paper in the proceedings will be assigned unique DOIs by CrossRef. Selected papers will be published in a Special Issue in the Open-Access Journal "<i>Journal of Fluid Flow, Heat and Mass Transfer</i>" by Avestia Publishing. For more information, in regards to the journal and Avestia Publishing, please visit our website at <a href="http://avestia.com/" class="body-link">www.avestia.com</a>.</p>

    <p class="body">All papers must be presented by one of the authors. At least one author <b>must</b> register for the conference and pay the fee prior to Regular Registration deadline (see <a href="../dates" class="body-link">Important Dates</a>) in order for the paper to be published in the conference proceedings and accepted in the final program.</p>

    <blockquote>Two best paper awards will be conferred to author(s) of the papers that receive the highest rank during the peer-review and by the respected session chairs. Only papers presented at the conference will be eligible for this award. Winners receive a certificate, 25% discount towards registration for the 2020 series of the conference, and can submit their papers to a related journal by Avestia Publishing for free publication (subject to a second round of peer-review).</blockquote>
